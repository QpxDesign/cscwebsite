# Computer Science Club Website
 
This website is made using SvelteKit.

To run the website locally, run the following commands after cloning:

```bash
cd cscwebsite
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

To add a page, create a new folder in the `src/routes` directory. The name of the folder will be the name of the page. Inside the folder, create a `+page.svelte` file. This file will be the content of the page.

You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the `+page.svelte` file. You can also use Svelte components. Take a look at  existing pages for inspiration.

Images, fonts, and other assets can be placed in the `static` directory.
